This is for my VEX vehicle intended to navigate through a course.
It is written in Python with VEXcode.
More specifically, it is written to drive straight 3 times and make 2 full turns.

Here's a simple design of the track:
     Turn
|   | ( ) |   | 
|   |     |   |  
|   |     |   |      end
|   |     |   |     |   | 
|   |     |   |     |   | 
|   |     |   | ( ) |   | 
start
